## Features

- **AI Opponent**: Play against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Option to play with a friend on the same device.
- **Dynamic Starting Player**: Choose who starts the gameâ€”either player or AI.
- **Game Statistics**: Track wins, losses, and ties for both players.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly controls and responsive game board.
